# SI206-p3
Final project for SI206

Group Name: 黄河 Huang He 

Aaron Huang ahuanga@umich.edu, Grace Ho gracedh@umich.edu

API:    CoinDesk: https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice/<CODE>.json
CoinGecko: https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/ 

We will be getting the bitcoin price in USD of each supported bitcoin type from the CoinDesk API and the exchange rate of USD to another currency from the CoinGecko API.

The data that will be calculated is the price of the selected bitcoin type in different currencies such as RMB or RUB.

We will be using the Seaborn visualization package.

We will be creating bar graphs for the cost of one Bitcoin in different currencies as well as overlapping line graphs for different cryptocurrencies in the same currency over a period of time. 

Aaron will be responsible for the planning and visualization of data from the database into the graphs and Grace will be responsible for the pulling of data from the APIs. Both will assist each other when there are points of confusion and conflict.
