# SI206-p3
Final project for SI206

Group Name: 黄河 Huang He 

Aaron Huang ahuanga@umich.edu, Grace Ho gracedh@umich.edu

API:    CoinDesk: https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice/<CODE>.json
CoinGecko: https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/ 

We will be getting the bitcoin price in USD of each supported bitcoin type from the CoinDesk API and the exchange rate of USD to another currency from the CoinGecko API.

The data that will be calculated is the price of the selected bitcoin type in different currencies such as RMB or RUB.

We will be using the Seaborn visualization package.

We will be creating bar graphs for the cost of one Bitcoin in different currencies as well as overlapping line graphs for different cryptocurrencies in the same currency over a period of time. 

Aaron will be responsible for the planning and visualization of data from the database into the graphs and Grace will be responsible for the pulling of data from the APIs. Both will assist each other when there are points of confusion and conflict. 

LETTER PROMPT START

REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

Dear Mr. Sir,

I am Dr. Bakare Tunde, the cousin of Nigerian Astronaut, Air Force Major Abacha Tunde. He was the first African in space when he made a secret flight to the Salyut 6 space station in 1979. He was on a later Soviet spaceflight, Soyuz T-16Z to the secret Soviet military space station Salyut 8T in 1989. He was stranded there in 1990 when the Soviet Union was dissolved. His other Soviet crew members returned to Earth on the Soyuz T-16Z, but his place was taken up by return cargo. There have been occasional supply flights to keep him going since then. He is in good spirits, but he wants to come home.

In the 31 years since he has been on the station, he has accumulated flight pay and interest amounting to almost 5.71 billion Nigerian Naira. This is held in a trust at the Lagos National Savings and Trust Association. If we can obtain access to this money, we can place a down payment with the Russian Space Authorities for a Soyuz return flight to bring him back to Earth. I am told this will cost 1.14 billion Nigerian Naira. In order to access his trust fund, we need your assistance.

However, the Russian Space Authorities need the amount transferred to them to be in American dollars. We must keep this transaction under the radar. In order to do this, we ask you to take the Nigerian Naira amount from us, convert it into Bitcoin, and then take that amount in Bitcoin to convert to American dollars.

Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account or subsequent disbursement, since we, as civil servants, are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Service Laws) from opening and/or operating foreign accounts in our names.

Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return, we have agreed to offer you 20 percent of the transferred sum, while 10 percent shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal and external) between the parties in the course of the transaction. You will be mandated to remit the balance 70 percent to other accounts in due course.

Please calculate the conversion of the total transferred sum to Bitcoin from Naira, and then from Bitcoin to USD. Then calculate the 20 percent owed to you.

Yours sincerely, Dr. Bakare Tunde
Astronautics Project Manager
